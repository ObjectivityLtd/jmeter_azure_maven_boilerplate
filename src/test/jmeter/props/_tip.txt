In this approach tests configuration is controlled via usage of properties files.
You should create one user.properties files per environment and test variant. Put there all jmeter properties that you want to be able to change.
If there are common properties you can put them in base.user.properties
if you want to define optional thresholds for samplers create optional thresholds.properties in the same directory. You can then specify thresholds limits like this

    a) individual values, build will fail if there is at least 1 request over threshold e.g. (times are in ms)
        POST /api/dummy=5000

    b) percetile-based values, build will fail if there is e.g. 5% requets higher than threshold (95-th percentile)
        POST /api/dummy=5000=95

Build will fail even if all requests are successful but some are over the threshold.
